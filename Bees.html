<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">This blog is dedicated to all things security and Dr. Wilkes Senior Seminar.</p>
<h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=6 data-line-end=7><a id="2221__Ethics__Maybe_some_Security_6"></a>2/2/21 - Ethics &amp; Maybe some Security</h1>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">To be honest this was just click bait, not so much security as it is really just ethics.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">It was really interesting to hear the wide range of beliefs regarding ethics, morals and other things that were discussed in class. Personally to me it even more intersting to see the similarities in almost everyones beliefs but in particular to see what they attributed that too.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">For example the golden rule is important to me and coming from religion, Leviticus 19:34 “love them as yourself” thats a huge stem of that phrase. Whereas others attribute it to different roots, but we all believe it.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">To sum it all up, you are the sum of your expereinces, and it was neat to see how everyone felt about choosing others over themselves or vice versa.</p>
<h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=15 data-line-end=16><a id="12721__The_Bee_Informed_Group__Cyber_Security_15"></a>1/27/21 - The Bee Informed Group &amp; Cyber Security</h1>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">There have honestly been very few moments in my career as a computer science student where I have thouroughly enjoyed myself. I often feel computer science students are pushed into the completion of very specific topics which almost always seem to gear toward some sort of development of theory. When I took Professor Larry Bridges Cybersecurity class however, that was not the case.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20">Upon talking to Mr. Bridges following the first class, I was invited to participate in a penetration and vulnerability test of a local group call The Bee Informed Group. The honors group of students + 1 (Me) was set to test some of their provided websites to test the security posture. This was a truely a unique experience opening my eyes to the future of cybersecurity as a career as it was the first time I had really done something different.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">We used Kali Linux, an offensive set of security tools, and various other methods to attempt to break into there site upon finding vulnerabilities. I loved it. Building on this is what lead to my best outside of class experience.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">Using what I had learned in that class, my experience had helped me to get a job at Allscripts as a Cyber Defense Intern with Incident Response. In this position everyday I use my knowledge of computer systems, database, and deductive reasoning to “find the bad guys” and keep our data safe. Its my dream job and it’s all because of having the experience to be able to take a different class.</p>
