<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">This blog is dedicated to all things security and Dr. Wilkes Senior Seminar.</p>
<h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=2 data-line-end=3><a id="3821__Citizenfour_2"></a>3/8/21 - Citizenfour</h1>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">I am very fascinated with Edward Snowdens story. At the end of the day he did expose the invasive behavior of Big Brother, but he did do it in an illegal manner. A negative plus a negative doesnt always equal a positive.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">That being said the most interesting part of that documentary was not just the information he had stollen and shared, but his knowledge and fear that he could be apprehended at any moment. He knew that what he had stollen was so sensitive that people would know immediatley.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">Overall my opinion has not changed. The government is good, and the goverment is bad, just like the idea of what Snowden did was good, but how he did it was bad. There are two sides to every coin and the freedom you get when you choose to live in America is by no means free.</p>
<h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=9 data-line-end=10><a id="3221__Privacy_9"></a>3/2/21 - Privacy</h1>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">There are definitely companies who hide the worst of the worst in their privacy policies, but theres also companies who are honest, and try their best to explain it to you. More of the former, and less of the later I’d say.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">This being said, something I thought was really interesting was the fact that most corporations we discussed seemed to have this fact persona of a “simple” privacy policy that on first glance seems short sweet and to the point but in reality is not like that at all.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">I dont remember the company that was discussed in class but I remember that there was one company that actually made it look like there policy was short, and used colors to try and represent that it was finished. However, once you scrolled down it would just… keep… going…</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">I thought that was interesting because of the time and effort they put into obfuscating the actual meaning.</p>
<h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=20 data-line-end=21><a id="2221__Ethics__Maybe_some_Security_20"></a>2/2/21 - Ethics &amp; Maybe some Security</h1>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">To be honest this was just click bait, not so much security as it is really just ethics.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">It was really interesting to hear the wide range of beliefs regarding ethics, morals and other things that were discussed in class. Personally to me it even more intersting to see the similarities in almost everyones beliefs but in particular to see what they attributed that too.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">For example the golden rule is important to me and coming from religion, Leviticus 19:34 “love them as yourself” thats a huge stem of that phrase. Whereas others attribute it to different roots, but we all believe it.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28">To sum it all up, you are the sum of your expereinces, and it was neat to see how everyone felt about choosing others over themselves or vice versa.</p>
<h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=29 data-line-end=30><a id="12721__The_Bee_Informed_Group__Cyber_Security_29"></a>1/27/21 - The Bee Informed Group &amp; Cyber Security</h1>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="32">There have honestly been very few moments in my career as a computer science student where I have thouroughly enjoyed myself. I often feel computer science students are pushed into the completion of very specific topics which almost always seem to gear toward some sort of development of theory. When I took Professor Larry Bridges Cybersecurity class however, that was not the case.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="33" data-line-end="34">Upon talking to Mr. Bridges following the first class, I was invited to participate in a penetration and vulnerability test of a local group call The Bee Informed Group. The honors group of students + 1 (Me) was set to test some of their provided websites to test the security posture. This was a truely a unique experience opening my eyes to the future of cybersecurity as a career as it was the first time I had really done something different.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="35" data-line-end="36">We used Kali Linux, an offensive set of security tools, and various other methods to attempt to break into there site upon finding vulnerabilities. I loved it. Building on this is what lead to my best outside of class experience.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="38">Using what I had learned in that class, my experience had helped me to get a job at Allscripts as a Cyber Defense Intern with Incident Response. In this position everyday I use my knowledge of computer systems, database, and deductive reasoning to “find the bad guys” and keep our data safe. Its my dream job and it’s all because of having the experience to be able to take a different class.</p>
